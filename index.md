## Lab focus

Our computational neuroscience lab focuses on neuronal coding and ensemble modelling; with empahsis on machine learning approaches specifically designed for identifying neuronal activity dynamics.
Our methododology stems from the combination of operators in reproducing kernel-hilbert spaces with nonlinear dynamical systems, through close collaborations with experimental labs in human and animal neurophysiology _in vivo_ and _in vitro_.
